A Modular JavaScript Plugin Boilerplate for WordPress
=====================================================

## What & Why?

If JavaScript is a "first-class citizen" in your plugin, you may have a lot of it. If you have a lot of JavaScript, you should probably be modularizing your code and splitting those modules up into files to aid development.

[Require.js](http://requirejs.org) is a popular tool for authoring JavaScript in the AMD format ("Asynchronous Module Definition"). AMD is great, but it can be daunting to get up and running with all the configuration needed to take advantage of requireâ€”*especially* if you're going to be doing so within a WordPress theme or plugin! This boilerplate is an attempt to provide an example of a basic AMD setup, with all of that WordPress-specific configuration provided.

## A Note on File Structure

There are only a few modules defined in this repository, so that you don't have to delete too much of my code before you can write your own. Consult the [recommended directory structure](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#jsfiles) from the Require.js website for more thorough best-practices around code organization.

## Important Note on using Require within WordPress

This demo shows how to break your code into AMD modules, and how to load those modules into WordPress. *In SCRIPT_DEBUG mode, this plugin currently loads RequireJS itself: This will break some specific libraries used by WordPress, primarily Backbone.* In production you should always use the *optimized version* of your app. Require-related code is removed in the build process, so your scripts will not conflict with other WordPress scripts and plugins.
 
For more background on structuring your code see the slides for [Modular JavaScript](http://kadamwhite.github.io/talks/2014/modular-javascript-pvd) from WordCamp Providence, where I presented on this demo plugin and explained the underlying concepts.

## Other Resources

This is a sampling of other AMD or Modular JS resources I've found through some cursory Googling. **If you find other resources, please let me know on twitter or by opening an issue (see below):** for Require in particular I know there are other great resources out there, but I need help rounding them up!
